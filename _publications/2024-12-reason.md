We explore the use of multi-stage prompting with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in generating legal analysis. We break the complex legal problems into small steps, including initial analysis, legal query formulation, legal sources retrieval, legal reasoning, result consolidation, and output generation. The design of this framework emulates the process a legal professional in a common law system approaches the problem.
